        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Before starting this workshop, I'd like to solve some ideas people have about AI, or LLMs in general.</i>
        <ol>
            <li>LLMs are <i>nothing more</i> than a word machine.<br>It doesn't think, it just predicts the next word
                based on the previous words.</li>
            <li>AI is <i>biased</i>.<br>It reflects the biases present in the data it was trained on.</li>
            <li>AI is fallible.<br>It <i>can</i> make mistakes and should be used with caution.</li>
            <li>AI is not only for tech-savvy people.<br>With proper guidance, <i>anyone</i> can use AI tools
                effectively, depending on what they're doing.</li>
            <li>AI, at the end of the day, is a tool.<br><i>Like any tool, it can be used for good or bad purposes
                    depending on the user.</i></li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>The 4 Rules to use any AI Tool Effectively</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Give Context</li>
            <p>The day before your exam, when you open chatgpt or gemini, and say "Explain data types in C"
                its like walking upto a random person on the street (who just happens to be a CS scholar)
                and asking them the same question. It leaves them unprepared, lacking context.</p>
            <li>Give them a Persona</li>
            <p>When I sing a song to my GF, and ask her how it was, she's gonna say it was lovely or that it was really
                nice.
                Let's say I ask my friend Ananthu, a music producer, for feedback. He's going to give me a more
                technical critique,
                focusing on the key, tempo, and quality etc.<br>
                You decide whether you want the 'GF' or 'Ananthu' when you ask an LLM about something.<br>
                For example: "Explain data types in C as if you are a college professor teaching first year students."
                <br>
                (This rule may or may not be relevant for future models)
            </p>
            <li>Provide Examples</li>
            <p>Set the output, don't give the AI any room for errors. When you go to a barbershop, tell him you want it
                short on the sides,
                with a little bit on top sometimes he gives you motta crap and makes you look like Vijay from friends.
                Instead, you could have show'ed him a photo, so he looks at it for a second and nods.</p>
            <li>Set Constraints</li>
            <p>AI is a yapper and a people pleaser. Your job is to minimize the yapping.
                If you're looking for a specific format or length, say so.
                For example: "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points." This helps the AI understand your expectations
                better.</p>
        </ol>
        <h2>AI Tools for Students</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://notebooklm.google" target="_blank">NotebookLM</a>
            </li>
            <img src="/media/ai/notebooklm.png" width="600" alt="NotebookLM Screenshot">
            <p>A smart notebook that helps you organize your thoughts and ideas. The overviews are good, especially
                video and infographics.
                I like plugging in government datasets and the infographics come out really nice, often revealing
                insights I hadn't thought of.</p>
            </p>
            <li><a href="https://claude.ai" target="_blank">Claude</a></li>
            <img src="/media/ai/claude.png" width="600" alt="Claude Screenshot">
            <p>An AI assistant, better than chatgpt right now, for writing and brainstorming ideas.
                Gets rate limited more easily, but it gives more "usefulness" per token than whatever OpenAI has been
                doing for a while.</p>
            <li><a href="https://perplexity.ai" target="_blank">Perplexity</a></li>
            <img src="/media/ai/perplexity.png" width="600" alt="Perplexity Screenshot">
            <p>Search engine + LLMs that helps you explore complex topics and find answers quickly.<br>
                Ex: "What should i know before the markets open today?"</p>
            <li><a href="https://gamma.ai" target="_blank">Gamma</a></li>
            <img src="/media/ai/gamma.png" width="600" alt="Gamma Screenshot">
            <p>An AI-powered platform for creating presentations and visual content. I made the presentation for this
                workshop here from a suggestion by Claude.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Which should tell you that using these AI tools on their own leaves little to be desired.<br>
            The key to using them effectively is to combine them with the 4 rules mentioned above.
            Say you have to take a seminar on a topic you know nothing about.<br>
            You could use Perplexity to get a quick overview of the topic, then use Claude to brainstorm ideas and
            structure your presentation,
            and finally use Gamma to create visually appealing slides.<br></p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Split your thinking into steps, use the right tool for each step, and apply the 4 rules to get the best
            results.<br>
            Always experiment, reiterate, and refine your prompts to improve what you get. It's a loop of constantly
            finding out what works
            best with these ever-changing models.<br>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <small>J. A Anderson</small>: ...because it is sometimes believed that a brainlike computing device,
            if we could build it, will immediately become a wonder network capable of solving all our problems. We hope
            to show that
            there is no magic in neural networks. Networks do suggest, however, a number of fascinating and useful ideas
            that in the long run
            are of more value than magic.
